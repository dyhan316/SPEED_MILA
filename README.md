# SPEED
# Scalable Preprocessing of EEG Data For Self-Supervised Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and resources for the paper "[SPEED: Scalable Preprocessing of EEG Data for Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08065)" presented at the 2024 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing. The pipeline is designed to efficiently preprocess large-scale EEG data for self-supervised learning models, improving stability and performance on downstream tasks.

### Key Features:
- **Scalable Preprocessing:** Efficient handling of large EEG datasets, such as the Temple University Hospital EEG Corpus.
- **Self-Supervised Learning Compatibility:** Optimized for SSL frameworks to enhance model performance on various downstream tasks.
- **Comprehensive Quality Assessment:** Includes several quality checks, such as bad channel detection, artifact removal (e.g., line noise), and ICA for component classification.
- **Support for Multiple EEG Datasets:** Preprocessing steps tailored for TUH EEG, MMIDB, and other datasets.

## Repository Structure

- `configs/`: Contains configuration files to customize the preprocessing pipeline (e.g., datasets, channels, filtering options).
- `examples/`: Examples of how to use the SPEED pipeline, analyze of results and example of how to load the preprocessed data.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts to automate various tasks such as data download, preprocessing, and model training.
- `src/`: Contains all the scripts responsible for the core preprocessing of EEG data (e.g., filtering, bad channel detection, ICA).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the necessary Python packages to run the pipeline.
- `requirements_dev.txt`: Additional dependencies for development purposes (e.g., testing, linting).

## How to Run the Pipeline

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndersGMadsen/SPEED.git
cd SPEED
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Preprocess the Data
The preprocessing script is designed to handle large EEG datasets such as the **TUH EEG Corpus** and **MMIDB** dataset. Ensure the paths to these datasets are configured in the `configs/` directory.

Run the preprocessing as follows:
```bash
python scripts/preprocess.py --config configs/preprocessing_config.yaml
```

This script will process the EEG data using the methods described in the paper, including:
- Standardizing channels and detecting bad channels
- Applying filters (high-pass and low-pass)
- Running Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for artifact removal (optional)
- Interpolating missing channels and resampling to a uniform rate

You can modify preprocessing steps (e.g., include or skip ICA) by updating the configuration files in the `configs/` folder.

The script is able to run in parallel and exports the preprocessed data into multiple HDF5 files.

### 4. Combine Preprocessed Data (Optional)
To combine your preprocessed data to fewer files, run the provided script:
```bash
python scripts/hdf5_combiner.py {input_folder} {output_folder}
```
You can modify the maximum filesize by the argument ```--file_size```. The default value is 2000 (MB). 

<!-- ### 5. Training a Self-Supervised Learning Model
After preprocessing, the data can be fed into SSL models such as BENDR or custom models for pretraining:
```bash
python scripts/train_ssl_model.py --data-dir preprocessed_data/ --model bendr
``` -->

## Important Files

### `scripts/preprocess.py`
This script orchestrates the entire preprocessing workflow. It takes the configuration from `configs/` and processes the EEG data according to the steps defined in the paper.

- **--config:** Config file (`YAML`) specifying datasets, channels, filters, output directory and more.

### `scripts/hdf5_combiner.py`
This script combines the many HDF5 files that comes from a result of the preprocessing.

### `examples/data_loader.ipynb`
This notebook contains a PyTorch dataloader class that is designed for the preprocessed data and which is optimized for large scale.


<!-- ### `src/pipeline.py`
Contains class for the preprocessing pipeline.

### `src/methods.py`

### `src/utils.py` -->

## Configuring the Preprocessing Pipeline

The SPEED pipeline can be customized using YAML configuration files, allowing you to control key preprocessing parameters like filter frequencies, ICA settings, and more.

### Example Configuration File

```yaml
pipeline:
  class_path: preprocessing.pipeline.DynamicPipeline
  init_args:
    lp_freq: 75
    do_ica: False
    line_freqs: [60]
dataset_path: {DATASET_PATH}
out_path: {OUTPUT_PATH}
log_path: {LOG_PATH}
overwrite: False
shuffle_files: True
batch_size: 4
n_jobs: 16
```
